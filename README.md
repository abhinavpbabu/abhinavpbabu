# Hi, I'm Abhinav Babu

Welcome to my GitHub profile! 

## About Me

I’m Abhinav. I make websites because I have nothing better to do.

I’m building a [site](https://manim.runwith.cloud) that renders Manim videos because apparently I enjoy pain. I also make a few [YouTube videos](https://youtube.com/@the_sophile) when my brain decides to cooperate. Between those two, I get to turn abstract ideas into something that actually looks and works like it should, which is close enough to “beautiful” for me.

If you’re here to judge, borrow, or quietly inspect the chaos I call projects, feel free. The code holds up.
